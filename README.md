Developed by: Dylan O'Connor and Marco Zivkovic

Lark Zombie:

Story:
You are apart of a small group of survivors who've managed to set up a safe haven of sorts in a dead city. A cataclysmic apocalypse has occurred, and what remains is
desolation, ruin, and stories of horrifying things in this hopeless world. Your goal is to survive with what little hope left you have of a sustainable future.
Thankfully, some of the people left are willing to help you in your struggle for life... Especially since rumor has been going around that something big
is coming in a week. Thankfully, a millitary convoy has been heard on the radio and is supposed to be travelling through your encampents area.
Your task is to find enough supplies to sustain you and your encampent till this convoy arrives. With little aid, will you be able to make it out of this
nightmare alive?

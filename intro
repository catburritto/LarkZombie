You awake from terrible nightmares to a new day inside of a musty tent. You eat from a can, things are not as good as they used to be before the chaos and destruction.
You walk outside your tent greeted by all the friendly faces around camp. These people make the camp feel like home. 
You do not do much around the camp, but rather go on adventures around the city and gather supplies. It is a dangerous job. 
You await new missions and task from the people around the camp. 
From across the camp you can see your fearless leader Kyle. Without Kyle things would be pretty hopeless. 
There have been rumors across camp that the military is coming to rescue you in a week. You are feeling more optimistic than you have ever felt. 
For now, you need to survive the week...
